Here we will creating Photo Gallery from a Directory in server via Node js.

First you need to clone my repo, you can change photos from uploads folder. 
Go to your directory where you want to put this code and open terminal from there then type this command,

```
git clone https://github.com/PIYUSH9090/Node-photo-gallary
